        <h2>Dwayne Johnson never over-stresses body for a certain look on screen
        </h2>

        <img src="Assets/img/n.4.jpg" alt="">

        <p>Dwayne Johnson’s personal strength and fitness coach Dave Rienzi says the Hollywood superstar never needs to
            take drastic measures or over-stress his body to obtain a certain look.

            “We hold his conditioning in a very tight window to allow him to be ‘scene ready’ at any moment. Keeping him
            at striking distance ensures that we never need to take drastic measures to obtain a certain look, or
            over-stress his body. The bottom line is that he always needs to be able to perform at his best on screen,”
            said Rienzi, according to femalefirst.co.uk.

            Johnson, who shot to fame as The Rock in the world of professional wrestling before cracking Hollywood, is
            also on a very strict diet, says his coach.

            “The execution of his diet and training needs to be as nuanced and complimentary as possible to allow him to
            do that consistently,” he said in an interview with Muscle & Fitness magazine.</p>

        <h2>Bangladesh keen to work with China for research, production of Covid vaccine: President
        </h2>

        <img src="Assets/img/n.5.jpg" alt="">

        <p>Welcoming the Chinese Defence Minister, the President said China is one of the most important development
            partners of Bangladesh. China’s relationship with Bangladesh is gradually expanding in various fields,
            including trade and investment. Chinese investment in various sectors, including infrastructure and
            communication, is playing an important role in the socio-economic development of Bangladesh.

            The President thanked his Chinese counterpart on behalf of himself and the people of Bangladesh for
            providing the video message on the birth centenary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman
            and the Golden Jubilee of Independence.

            President Hamid said China has very good relations with Myanmar. By exploiting this relationship, China can
            play an important role in repatriating the forcibly displaced Rohingyas.

            He hoped that China would take effective steps in this regard.

            Referring to the defence relations between Bangladesh and China, the President hoped that these relations
            would be further strengthened in the days to come.</p>

            of people, said road transport and bridges minister Obaidul Quader on Wednesday.

            Earlier, Obaidul Quader, also general secretary of ruling Awami League, paid homage to Shaheed Sheikh Jamal,
            son of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, by placing wreaths at his Banani graveyard
            marking his 68th birth anniversary.

            The senior party leader paid homage on behalf of prime minister Sheikh Hasina first and then for the party.
